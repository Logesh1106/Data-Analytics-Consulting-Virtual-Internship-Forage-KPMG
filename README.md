# Data-Analytics-Consulting-Virtual-Internship-Forage-KPMG

The KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship is designed to help you gain a practical insight into the work we do at KPMG and it is an opportunity for you to build your career skills and experience.

The Internship consists of 3 tasks:
1. Data Quality Assessment
2. Data Insights
3. Data Insights and Presentation

Main objective is to find top 1000 high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.

I have used RFM analysis to find the top 1000 customers.
